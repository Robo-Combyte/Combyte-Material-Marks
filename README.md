**Heavy Work-In-Progress!!!** Wood and Metal Nodes only at this moment, Plants will come later. This package will be updated as I continue to mark new Nodes on my own time.

A simple collection of markers to be used in BlishHUD/GW2TacO which displays all the Material Node locations I have currently marked for convenience of knowing where things are. 

Due to the way Nodes are created, not all Markers will determine the accurate number of Nodes currently on the map you decide to gather in, 
this package was created just to know potential locations for nodes giving you a better idea of where to look for them rather than cluelessly searching in areas that nodes don't exist at all.

This also clues in that not all maps are 100% Marked!!! Some Nodes change into different nodes as well (Like how Rich Iron and Rich Silver exchange sometimes in places like Kessex Hills)
and some Nodes may be missed due to not having been created at the time of marking and will require additional passes to include them all eventually.
